## üöÄ **TESTING STEPS FOR BABU**

### **STEP 1: Start the Service**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\babu\Documents\Services\KiteMarketDataService.Worker
dotnet run
```

**Watch for:**
- ‚úÖ Authentication successful
- ‚úÖ Instruments loading
- ‚úÖ Historical spot data collection
- ‚úÖ Time-based data collection starts
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

### **STEP 2: Let It Run for One Complete Cycle**
**Wait for:**
- First data collection cycle to complete (about 2-3 minutes)
- You should see:
  ```
  üîÑ Collecting HISTORICAL SPOT DATA...
  ‚úÖ HISTORICAL SPOT DATA collection completed!
  
  üîÑ Starting TIME-BASED DATA COLLECTION...
  ‚úÖ TIME-BASED DATA COLLECTION completed!
  
  üîÑ Processing LC/UC CHANGES...
  ```

### **STEP 3: Stop the Service**
```
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

### **STEP 4: Run Verification Queries**
```powershell
# Run the verification script
sqlcmd -S "localhost" -d "KiteMarketData" -i "VerifyDataCollection_AfterTest.sql" -o "TestResults.txt"

# View results
notepad TestResults.txt
```

## üîç **WHAT TO CHECK IN RESULTS**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Table Row Counts**
```
Expected:
- Instruments: > 0 (should have NIFTY/SENSEX/BANKNIFTY options)
- SpotData: > 0 (should have historical OHLC data)
- MarketQuotes: > 0 (should have collected options data)
- CircuitLimitChanges: Could be 0 (only if LC/UC changed)
- IntradayTickData: > 0 (minute snapshots)
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ SpotData Check (CRITICAL)**
```
Check:
‚úÖ IndexName: NIFTY, SENSEX, BANKNIFTY present
‚úÖ TradingDate: Should have proper dates
‚úÖ DataSource: Should show "Kite Historical API" for historical data
‚úÖ OpenPrice, ClosePrice, LastPrice: All should have values > 0

TIME-AWARE CHECK (YOUR FIX):
- If run BEFORE 3:30 PM: TradingDate should be YESTERDAY or earlier
- If run AFTER 3:30 PM: TradingDate should include TODAY
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ BusinessDate Check (MOST CRITICAL)**
```
This is the MAIN test!

Check:
‚úÖ Pre-market data (before 9:15 AM):
   - RecordDateTime: e.g., 2025-10-08 08:30:00
   - BusinessDate: Should be 2025-10-07 (PREVIOUS day)
   - Status: Should show "‚úÖ CORRECT (Previous day)"

‚úÖ Market hours data (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM):
   - RecordDateTime: e.g., 2025-10-08 10:30:00
   - BusinessDate: Should be 2025-10-08 (CURRENT day)
   - Status: Should show "‚úÖ CORRECT (Current day)"

‚úÖ Post-market data (after 3:30 PM):
   - RecordDateTime: e.g., 2025-10-08 16:00:00
   - BusinessDate: Should be 2025-10-08 (CURRENT day)
   - Status: Should show "‚úÖ CORRECT (Current day)"

‚ùå If you see "‚ùå WRONG" or "‚ùå NEEDS REVIEW":
   ‚Üí BusinessDate calculation has issues
   ‚Üí We need to fix it
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Sample Market Quotes**
```
Check:
‚úÖ TradingSymbol: Should show NIFTY/SENSEX/BANKNIFTY options
‚úÖ Strike, OptionType (CE/PE): Should be populated
‚úÖ LastPrice: Should have values
‚úÖ LC (LowerCircuitLimit): Should have values > 0
‚úÖ UC (UpperCircuitLimit): Should have values > 0
‚úÖ LastTradeTime: Should NOT be NULL or 1/1/0001
‚úÖ BusinessDate: Should match the period (pre-market = previous day, etc.)
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ LC/UC Values (YOUR FOCUS)**
```
Check:
‚úÖ LowerCircuitLimit (LC): Should have proper values
‚úÖ UpperCircuitLimit (UC): Should have proper values
‚úÖ LC_UC_Range: Should show the range between LC and UC

Example good data:
TradingSymbol: NIFTY24OCT25000CE
Strike: 25000
LastPrice: 118.50
LC: 50.00
UC: 150.00
LC_UC_Range: 100.00

This is what NSE adjusts daily! üéØ
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Duplicate Check**
```
Expected:
Should show NO RESULTS (no duplicates)

‚ùå If duplicates found:
   ‚Üí Something is wrong with duplicate prevention logic
   ‚Üí We need to fix it
```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Circuit Limit Changes**
```
Check:
- If service ran for only 1 cycle: Probably 0 changes (normal)
- If ran for multiple cycles: Should show LC/UC changes if they occurred

Example:
TradingSymbol: NIFTY24OCT25000CE
OldLC: 50.00 ‚Üí NewLC: 45.00
OldUC: 150.00 ‚Üí NewUC: 155.00
ChangedAt: 2025-10-08 10:32:15
BusinessDate: 2025-10-08

This is what you're tracking! üéØ
```

## üìã **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **Data Collection Accuracy:**
- [ ] SpotData has historical data with correct dates
- [ ] SpotData has "Kite Historical API" as DataSource
- [ ] After 3:30 PM, SpotData includes TODAY's data (YOUR FIX)
- [ ] No duplicate entries in SpotData

### **BusinessDate Accuracy (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] Pre-market data (before 9:15 AM) ‚Üí BusinessDate = PREVIOUS day
- [ ] Market hours data (9:15-3:30) ‚Üí BusinessDate = CURRENT day
- [ ] Post-market data (after 3:30) ‚Üí BusinessDate = CURRENT day
- [ ] All checks show "‚úÖ CORRECT" status

### **Market Quotes Quality:**
- [ ] All instruments from Instruments table are collected
- [ ] All strikes have LC and UC values
- [ ] LastTradeTime is valid (not NULL/MinValue)
- [ ] All fields populated (Bid, Ask, Last, OI)

### **LC/UC Tracking (YOUR USE CASE):**
- [ ] LC (LowerCircuitLimit) values present
- [ ] UC (UpperCircuitLimit) values present
- [ ] If changes detected, CircuitLimitChanges table populated
- [ ] Changes have correct BusinessDate

## üö® **EXPECTED ISSUES TO WATCH FOR**

### **Issue 1: Authentication Failure**
```
Symptom: Service stops with "Authentication failed"
Cause: RequestToken expired (expires daily)
Solution: Get fresh RequestToken from Kite login, update appsettings.json
```

### **Issue 2: No Historical Spot Data**
```
Symptom: SpotData table is empty after collection
Cause: Historical API call failed
Check: Service logs for API errors
```

### **Issue 3: Wrong BusinessDate**
```
Symptom: BusinessDate doesn't match expected values
Cause: Logic issue in BusinessDateCalculationService
Action: Share the BusinessDate Check results from query #5
```

### **Issue 4: Missing Options**
```
Symptom: Only few options collected, not all strikes
Cause: Instruments not loaded properly or API rate limiting
Check: Instruments table row count
```

---

## üìä **QUICK VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

### **Check Row Counts:**
```sql
USE KiteMarketData;
SELECT 'Instruments' AS [Table], COUNT(*) AS [Rows] FROM Instruments
UNION ALL SELECT 'SpotData', COUNT(*) FROM SpotData
UNION ALL SELECT 'MarketQuotes', COUNT(*) FROM MarketQuotes
UNION ALL SELECT 'CircuitLimitChanges', COUNT(*) FROM CircuitLimitChanges;
```

### **Check Latest BusinessDate:**
```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    BusinessDate,
    FORMAT(RecordDateTime, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') AS CollectedAt,
    TradingSymbol,
    Strike,
    LastPrice,
    LowerCircuitLimit AS LC,
    UpperCircuitLimit AS UC
FROM MarketQuotes
ORDER BY RecordDateTime DESC;
```

### **Check Spot Data:**
```sql
SELECT 
    IndexName,
    TradingDate,
    ClosePrice,
    DataSource
FROM SpotData
ORDER BY TradingDate DESC, IndexName;
```

---

## üéØ **DECISION POINTS**

### **If All Checks Pass ‚úÖ:**
```
Data collection is VERY VERY CORRECT! 
‚Üí Proceed to next steps:
   - Labeling system
   - LC/UC change analysis
   - Trading opportunity identification
```

### **If BusinessDate is Wrong ‚ùå:**
```
STOP - Fix BusinessDate logic first!
‚Üí Share the query results
‚Üí I'll help debug and fix
‚Üí Re-test after fix
```

### **If Duplicates Found ‚ùå:**
```
STOP - Fix duplicate prevention
‚Üí Share duplicate check results
‚Üí Fix logic
‚Üí Clear DB and re-test
```

### **If LC/UC Values Missing ‚ùå:**
```
STOP - Data collection incomplete
‚Üí Check if Kite API is returning LC/UC
‚Üí Verify field mapping
‚Üí Fix and re-test
```

## üí¨ **AFTER TESTING**

**Tell me:**
1. ‚úÖ Did service start successfully?
2. ‚úÖ Did it complete one full cycle?
3. ‚úÖ What do the verification results show?
4. ‚ùå Any errors in console or logs?
5. ‚ùå Any "‚ùå WRONG" status in BusinessDate check?

**Share:**
- Screenshot or copy-paste of verification results
- Any errors from console
- Specific issues you noticed

**Then we decide:**
- If all ‚úÖ ‚Üí Move to next phase (labeling, analysis)
- If any ‚ùå ‚Üí Fix issues first, then re-test

## üìÅ **FILES READY FOR YOU**

1. **VerifyDataCollection_AfterTest.sql** - Comprehensive verification queries
2. **ClearDatabaseForTest.sql** - If you need to clear and re-test
3. **Backup file** - Safe backup before test (3.2 GB)
