# Console Logging Fix - Reduce Verbosity

## Problem Identified
The service was displaying ALL detailed logs in the console, including:
- HTTP request/response details
- API batch processing logs  
- Detailed market data collection logs
- All Information-level logs from KiteConnectService

This made the console output very verbose and cluttered.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated appsettings.json
```json
"Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning",
        "Microsoft": "Warning", 
        "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information",
        "KiteMarketDataService.Worker.Services.KiteConnectService": "Warning",
        "KiteMarketDataService.Worker.Services.MarketDataService": "Warning",
        "KiteMarketDataService.Worker.Worker": "Information"
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated Program.cs Logging Configuration
- Added specific log level filters for console output
- Console now only shows Warning level and above for most services
- Worker service still shows Information level for startup messages
- File logger captures ALL logs (Information level and above)

### 3. Custom File Logger Enhancement
- File logger captures all log levels (Information and above)
- All detailed API logs go to file only
- Console shows clean, minimal output

## Result
- **Console**: Clean output with only essential messages and warnings
- **Log File**: Complete detailed logs for debugging and analysis
- **Separation**: Console for user monitoring, file for technical details

## Files Modified
1. `appsettings.json` - Updated logging configuration
2. `Program.cs` - Added console log filters and file logger configuration

## Testing
The service now builds successfully and will display clean console output while maintaining complete logging in the file system.
