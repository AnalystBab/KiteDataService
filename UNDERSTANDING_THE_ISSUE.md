# üéØ UNDERSTANDING THE REAL ISSUE

## YOUR SCENARIO:

**Timeline:**
- Oct 20 (Mon): Market OPEN - Service ran, collected data
- Oct 21 (Tue): HOLIDAY - No service run, no data
- Oct 22 (Wed): HOLIDAY - No service run, no data
- Oct 23 (Thu): Service starts at 8:45 AM

**At 8:30 AM on Oct 23:** LC/UC changed (service not running)
**At 8:45 AM on Oct 23:** Service starts

## ‚ùì QUESTION 1: What is Business Date at 8:45 AM on Oct 23?

**Time:** 8:45 AM (BEFORE market opens at 9:15 AM)

**Business Date Calculation Logic:**
```
Before 9:15 AM ‚Üí Still PREVIOUS business day
Previous business day = Oct 20 (last trading day)
```

**Result:**
```
Business Date at 8:45 AM on Oct 23 = Oct 20 ‚úÖ
```

**Wait, this seems wrong!**

Let me re-read the business date logic carefully...

Actually, let me think about this differently:

**When does a NEW business date start?**
- At 9:15 AM when market opens

**So at 8:45 AM on Oct 23:**
- Market hasn't opened yet
- NEW business day (Oct 23) hasn't started yet
- Still in PREVIOUS business day = Oct 20

**So Business Date = Oct 20 is CORRECT!** ‚úÖ

## ‚ùì QUESTION 2: What should be the baseline for Oct 20?

**You said:** "Last business date's latest record"

**Last business date before Oct 20 = Oct 19? NO, Oct 19 was a holiday!**
**Last business date before Oct 20 = Oct 17? NO, Oct 17 was also before weekend!**

**CORRECT:** Last business date before Oct 20 = **Oct 17 (Friday before the weekend)**

Wait, let me re-read your scenario...

You said:
- Oct 20 was last trading day
- Oct 21-22 were holidays

So the calendar should be:
- Oct 18 (Fri): Market OPEN
- Oct 19-20 (Weekend)
- Oct 21-22 (Holidays)
- Oct 23: Market opens

**OR you meant:**
- Oct 20 (Mon): Market OPEN
- Oct 21-22 (Tue-Wed): HOLIDAYS
- Oct 23 (Thu): Market opens

Let me assume the second:
- Oct 20 (Mon): Last trading day
- Previous business date before Oct 20 = Oct 17 (Fri)

**So baseline from Oct 17 is WRONG?**

**NO! Let me re-think...**

If Oct 20 is the current business date (at 8:45 AM on Oct 23),
then the baseline should be from **Oct 20 itself** (the LAST records from Oct 20)!

## üéØ THE REAL ISSUE:

**You're saying:**
- Current business date: Oct 20
- Baseline should be: **Oct 20's LAST records**
- NOT Oct 17 or Oct 19

**So the query should be:**
```sql
WHERE BusinessDate = Oct 20  (NOT < Oct 20)
ORDER BY RecordDateTime DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**IS THIS WHAT YOU MEAN?**
