## 🎯 **THE DISCOVERY:**

### **What Happened to 79800:**
```
During D0 day (9th Oct):
- Sequences 1-4: LC = 32.65 ✅ (LC > 0.05)
- Sequence 5: LC DROPS to 0.05 ❌ (LC = 0.05)
- Sequences 6-7: LC = 0.05 ❌ (LC = 0.05)

79800's LC CHANGED during the day!
```

### **Why This Matters:**
```
Our filter: "LC > 0.05"
79800 sequences 5-7: LC = 0.05 (doesn't meet filter!)
79800 sequences 1-4: LC = 32.65 (meets filter!)

MAX InsertionSequence with LC > 0.05 = 4
MAX InsertionSequence overall = 7
```

## 🔍 **CORRECTED LC PEAK ANALYSIS:**

### **Using MAX InsertionSequence with LC > 0.05:**
```
Strike    LC        Max_Seq_with_LC>0.05    Rank
------    ------    -------------------    ----
79000     730.25    7                       🥇 HIGHEST LC
79100     623.90    7                       🥈 2nd highest
79200     534.90    7                       🥉 3rd highest
79300     447.15    7                       4th
79400     360.90    7                       5th
79500     315.00    7                       6th
79600     193.10    7                       7th
79800     32.65     4                       8th (but Seq 4 only!)
```

### **The Issue:**
```
79800: MAX InsertionSequence with LC > 0.05 = 4
Others: MAX InsertionSequence with LC > 0.05 = 7

79800's LC dropped to 0.05 in sequence 5!
```

---

## 🎯 **WHAT THIS MEANS:**

### **79800 Analysis:**
```
✅ Sequences 1-4: LC = 32.65 (meaningful protection)
❌ Sequences 5-7: LC = 0.05 (minimal protection)

79800 had meaningful LC early in the day, but lost it later!
```

### **Why 79600 is Better:**
```
✅ Sequences 1-7: LC = 193.10 (consistent protection)
✅ LC never dropped during the day
✅ Consistent meaningful protection
```

---

## ✅ **CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING:**

### **LC Peak Method (Corrected):**
```
LC Peak: 79000 (LC = 730.25, Seq = 7) ✅
- Consistent LC throughout the day
- Maximum protection level
- Stable reference point
```

### **First LC > 0.05 Method (Corrected):**
```
First LC > 0.05: 79600 (LC = 193.10, Seq = 7) ✅
- Consistent LC throughout the day
- First substantial protection
- Stable reference point
```

### **79800 Status:**
```
79800: LC = 32.65 (Seq = 4 only) ⚠️
- Had protection early, lost it later
- Unstable reference point
- Not reliable for base strike selection
```

---

## 🚀 **CONCLUSION:**

### **Why 79800 Has InsertionSequence = 4:**
```
✅ 79800's LC dropped from 32.65 to 0.05 in sequence 5
✅ MAX InsertionSequence with LC > 0.05 = 4
✅ MAX InsertionSequence overall = 7 (but LC = 0.05)

This explains the discrepancy!
```

### **Corrected Analysis:**
```
✅ Use strikes with consistent LC throughout the day
✅ 79600: LC = 193.10 (stable) ✅
✅ 79000: LC = 730.25 (stable) ✅
⚠️ 79800: LC = 32.65 (unstable) ⚠️
```

**79800's LC changed during the day, which is why it has InsertionSequence = 4 instead of 7!** 🎯✅
