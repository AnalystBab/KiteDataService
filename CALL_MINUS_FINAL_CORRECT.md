# üî¥ CALL_MINUS PROCESS - FINAL CORRECT VERSION (All Subtractions!)

## üí° KEY INSIGHT: Only ONE UC changes at a time!
```
‚úÖ If CE UC increases ‚Üí Market moves UP (PUT_MINUS active)
‚úÖ If PE UC increases ‚Üí Market moves DOWN (CALL_MINUS active)
‚ùå Both cannot increase simultaneously!
```

## üî¥ **CALL_MINUS CALCULATION (Downward Movement - Mirror of PUT_MINUS)**

### **Step 1: Calculate CALL_MINUS**
```
LABEL: CALL_MINUS_VALUE
FORMULA: CLOSE_STRIKE - CLOSE_CE_UC_D0
CALCULATION: 82,100 - 1,920.85 = 80,179.15
MEANING: Upward protection level subtracted from spot (inverse of PUT_MINUS)
```

### **Step 2: Distance from Put Base**
```
LABEL: CALL_MINUS_TO_PUT_BASE_DISTANCE
FORMULA: PUT_BASE_STRIKE - CALL_MINUS_VALUE
CALCULATION: 84,700 - 80,179.15 = 4,520.85
MEANING: How far CALL_MINUS falls below Put Base
```

### **Step 3: Target Premium (PE)**
```
LABEL: CALL_MINUS_TARGET_PE_PREMIUM
FORMULA: CLOSE_PE_UC_D0 - CALL_MINUS_TO_PUT_BASE_DISTANCE
CALCULATION: 1,439.40 - 4,520.85 = -3,081.45 ‚ùå NEGATIVE!

ü§î PROBLEM: This gives negative premium...
```

---

## ü§î **ALTERNATIVE APPROACH - Try Different Order:**

### **Attempt 2: Reverse Distance Calculation**
```
Step 1: CALL_MINUS = 82,100 - 1,920.85 = 80,179.15 ‚úÖ

Step 2: Distance = CALL_MINUS - PUT_BASE
        80,179.15 - 84,700 = -4,520.85 (negative distance)
        
        Use absolute: 4,520.85

Step 3: Target Premium = CLOSE_PE_UC_D0 + Distance (because distance is below?)
        1,439.40 + 4,520.85 = 5,960.25

Step 4: Target Strike = CLOSE_STRIKE + Target Premium
        82,100 + 5,960.25 = 88,060.25 ‚Üí Strike 88,100

But this seems too high... ü§î
```

---

## üí° **ALTERNATIVE: Maybe CALL_MINUS Uses Different Base Logic?**

### **Attempt 3: Use CALL_MINUS as Addition Point?**
```
Step 1: CALL_MINUS = CLOSE_STRIKE + CLOSE_CE_UC_D0
        82,100 + 1,920.85 = 84,020.85

Step 2: Distance from Put Base
        84,700 - 84,020.85 = 679.15 ‚úÖ (positive!)

Step 3: Target Premium = CLOSE_PE_UC_D0 - Distance
        1,439.40 - 679.15 = 760.25 ‚úÖ (positive!)

Step 4: Target Strike = CLOSE_STRIKE + Target Premium
        82,100 + 760.25 = 82,860.25 ‚Üí Strike 82,900 ‚úÖ

This looks reasonable! But then it's CALL_PLUS, not CALL_MINUS? ü§∑
```

## üôè **PLEASE CLARIFY:**

**Which approach is correct?**

**Option A:** Strict subtraction but gets negative premium
**Option B:** Reverse distance with absolute value
**Option C:** Add CE UC (but then it's CALL_PLUS?)

**What I need to know:**

1. In Step 1, is it `82,100 - 1,920.85` or `82,100 + 1,920.85`?
2. If we get negative intermediate values, what do we do?
3. Why is it called CALL_MINUS if we need to add somewhere?
4. What's the exact formula for each step?

**Please teach me the correct CALL_MINUS step-by-step! üéì**
