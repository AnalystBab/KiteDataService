## üéØ PATTERN VALIDATION

### **TARGET_CE_PREMIUM Pattern Analysis:**

Our reference **TARGET_CE_PREMIUM = 1,084.60** was looking for PE strikes where **PE UC ‚âà 1,084.60**.

#### **80,400 PE Analysis:**
- **80,400 PE UC:** We need to check the Upper Circuit Limit
- **80,400 PE Close:** 117.90 (final premium)
- **80,400 PE High:** 186.20 (intraday high)

#### **Pattern Match Status:**
- **Reference:** TARGET_CE_PREMIUM = 1,084.60
- **80,400 PE Close:** 117.90
- **Difference:** 966.70 (89.1% difference)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** The PE close premium (117.90) is significantly lower than our TARGET_CE_PREMIUM (1,084.60). This suggests either:
1. The actual spot LOW was much lower than 80,400, OR
2. Our pattern needs refinement for different market conditions

## üìä PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS

### **What We Can Confirm:**
1. ‚úÖ **Extensive Option Data:** Complete option chain data available for 2025-10-13
2. ‚úÖ **80,400 Strike Active:** Both CE and PE options traded actively
3. ‚úÖ **Premium Movements:** Significant premium changes during the day
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pattern Deviation:** PE premiums much lower than predicted

### **Key Observations:**
1. **80,400 PE Premium:** 117.90 (vs predicted 1,084.60)
2. **80,400 CE Premium:** 2,533.25 (significant premium)
3. **Market Volatility:** High premium swings during the day

## üî¨ TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### **Premium Pattern Analysis:**

#### **80,400 Strike:**
- **CE Premium:** 2,533.25 (high premium suggests deep ITM)
- **PE Premium:** 117.90 (low premium suggests OTM or ATM)
- **Implication:** If CE is deep ITM and PE is low, spot might be above 80,400

#### **80,500 Strike:**
- **PE Premium:** 125.35 (similar to 80,400 PE)
- **Implication:** Consistent PE premium levels suggest similar strike positioning

### **Pattern Interpretation:**
The low PE premiums at 80,400 and 80,500 suggest:
1. **Spot LOW was likely ABOVE 80,400** (PE options not deep ITM)
2. **Our prediction of 80,400 as LOW may be TOO LOW**
3. **Actual LOW might be in 81,000-82,000 range**

## üéØ PREDICTION ACCURACY ASSESSMENT

- **Status:** ‚ùå **LIKELY INCORRECT**
- **Evidence:** Low PE premiums suggest spot didn't reach 80,400

### **HIGH Prediction (84,492):**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **BOUNDARY CORRECT**
- **Evidence:** Upper boundary limit is valid NSE constraint
- **Actual HIGH:** Unknown without spot data

### **CLOSE Prediction (82,152):**
- **Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING SPOT DATA**
- **Evidence:** Based on live spot during trading hours
- **Validation:** Requires actual EOD spot data
