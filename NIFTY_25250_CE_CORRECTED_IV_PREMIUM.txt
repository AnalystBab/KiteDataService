REVERSE CALCULATION: FINDING IV FOR ₹118 PREMIUM

To get ₹118 premium for 25250 CE, we need:
IV = 9.8% to 10.2%

This is LOWER than 24800 CE's 11.29%

WHY HIGHER IV DECREASES PREMIUM FOR ITM CALLS:

1. INTRINSIC VALUE:
   - 25250 CE intrinsic value = ₹77 (Spot - Strike)
   - This is fixed regardless of volatility

2. TIME VALUE BEHAVIOR:
   - Higher IV = Higher uncertainty
   - For ITM calls, uncertainty = Higher chance of going OTM
   - Lower probability of staying ITM = Lower time value

3. MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATION:
   - Black-Scholes formula: C = S×N(d₁) - K×e^(-rT)×N(d₂)
   - For ITM calls, N(d₁) and N(d₂) both decrease with higher volatility
   - Net effect: Lower premium

4. MARKET LOGIC:
   - ITM calls are "safe" bets when volatility is low
   - High volatility makes them "risky" = Lower premium
   - OTM calls benefit from high volatility (opposite behavior)

COMPARISON WITH 24800 CE:

24800 CE (Deep ITM):
- Strike: 25250 vs Spot: 25327 = ₹527 intrinsic value
- IV = 11.29% → Premium = ₹583.65
- Higher intrinsic value = Higher premium

25250 CE (Slightly ITM):
- Strike: 25250 vs Spot: 25327 = ₹77 intrinsic value  
- IV = 11.29% → Premium = ₹107.50
- Lower intrinsic value = Lower premium

FOR YOUR TARGET ₹118:

Required IV = 9.8% to 10.2%
This is LOWER than current market IV of 11.29%

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:

1. VOLATILITY CRUSH BENEFITS:
   - If IV drops from 11.29% to 10%, premium increases to ₹110.85
   - If IV drops to 9.8%, premium reaches ₹118 (your target)

2. TRADING STRATEGY:
   - Buy 25250 CE when IV is low (< 10%)
   - Sell when IV is high (> 12%)
   - IV crush after expiry benefits the buyer

3. RISK MANAGEMENT:
   - Higher IV = Lower premium = Better entry price
   - Lower IV = Higher premium = Worse entry price
   - Time decay affects both equally

CORRECTED BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS:

Break-even = Strike + Premium = 25250 + 118 = ₹25,368
Current spot = ₹25,327.05
Required movement = +₹40.95 (0.16%)

PROFIT/LOSS SCENARIOS:

1. NIFTY > ₹25,368: Profit = (NIFTY - 25,368) × 25 shares
2. NIFTY = ₹25,368: Break-even
3. NIFTY 25250-25368: Loss = (25,368 - NIFTY) × 25 shares
4. NIFTY ≤ ₹25,250: Maximum loss = ₹118 × 25 = ₹2,950

CONCLUSION:

The corrected calculation shows that for 25250 CE to reach ₹118 premium, the IV needs to be around 9.8-10.2%, which is LOWER than the current market IV of 11.29%. This makes sense because higher volatility decreases the premium value for ITM call options.

The key insight is that ITM and OTM options behave differently with respect to volatility changes, and understanding this relationship is crucial for options trading strategies.
