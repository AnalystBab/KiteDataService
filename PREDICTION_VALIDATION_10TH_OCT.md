## üí≠ **NEXT LEVEL THINKING:**

Now I need to:

1. **Predict CLOSE** - How to derive close price on D0?
2. **Predict Strike HLC** - Each option strike's high-low-close
3. **Multiple combinations** - Try different paths to cross-validate
4. **Intraday levels** - Can we predict support/resistance zones?
5. **Time-based predictions** - When will high/low occur?

**Am I thinking like you now? üéì**
