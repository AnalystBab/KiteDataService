# 🎯 MONITOR SERVICE PROGRESS

## 📊 **HOW TO TRACK PROGRESS:**

### **Method 1: Watch Log File (Best)**

Run this repeatedly to see latest logs:
```powershell
Get-Content "bin\Debug\net8.0\logs\KiteMarketDataService.log" -Tail 30
```

Or watch for specific messages:
```powershell
Get-Content "bin\Debug\net8.0\logs\KiteMarketDataService.log" | Select-String -Pattern "STRATEGY|SENSEX|BANKNIFTY|Excel" | Select-Object -Last 20
```

### **Method 2: Check Database**

```powershell
sqlcmd -S localhost -d KiteMarketData -Q "SELECT IndexName, COUNT(*) FROM StrategyLabels WHERE BusinessDate = '2025-10-09' GROUP BY IndexName" -W
```

### **Method 3: Check Excel Files**

```powershell
Test-Path "Exports\StrategyAnalysis\2025-10-09"
```

If true, then:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem "Exports\StrategyAnalysis\2025-10-09" -Recurse -Filter "*.xlsx"
```
