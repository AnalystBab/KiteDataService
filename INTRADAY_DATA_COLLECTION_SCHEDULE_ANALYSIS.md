## 🔍 **EVIDENCE FROM YOUR DATA:**

### **Current Intraday Data (2025-10-11):**

```
SENSEX: 4 records collected
├── 06:56:02 (2 records with different values)
└── 07:01:41 (2 records with different values)

NIFTY: 4 records collected  
├── 06:56:02 (2 records with different values)
└── 07:01:41 (2 records with different values)

BANKNIFTY: 4 records collected
├── 06:56:02 (2 records with different values)  
└── 07:01:41 (2 records with different values)
```

**This shows data collection at 06:56 and 07:01 (5 minutes apart) - this is the duplicate issue we identified!**

## ⚙️ **COLLECTION LOGIC:**

### **TimeBasedDataCollectionService Logic:**

```csharp
// Collection intervals
private readonly TimeSpan _marketHoursInterval = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);      // 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM
private readonly TimeSpan _afterHoursInterval = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);        // 3:30 PM - 6:00 AM  
private readonly TimeSpan _preMarketInterval = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(3);       // 6:00 AM - 9:15 AM

public TimeSpan GetNextCollectionInterval()
{
    var currentTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(5.5); // IST
    var timeOfDay = currentTime.TimeOfDay;

    if (IsPreMarketHours(timeOfDay))      // 6:00 AM - 9:15 AM
        return _preMarketInterval;        // 3 minutes
    else if (IsMarketHours(timeOfDay))    // 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM  
        return _marketHoursInterval;      // 1 minute
    else                                  // 3:30 PM - 6:00 AM (includes weekends)
        return _afterHoursInterval;       // 1 hour
}
```

### **Market Hours Detection:**

```csharp
private bool IsMarketHours(TimeSpan timeOfDay)
{
    return timeOfDay >= _marketOpen && timeOfDay <= _marketClose;
    // 9:15 AM <= time <= 3:30 PM
}

private bool IsPreMarketHours(TimeSpan timeOfDay)  
{
    return timeOfDay >= _preMarketStart && timeOfDay < _marketOpen;
    // 6:00 AM <= time < 9:15 AM
}
```

## 🎯 **ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS:**

### **1. Is intraday data collection running every minute after market close?**

**❌ NO** - It's running **every 1 hour** after market close (3:30 PM to 6:00 AM)

### **2. Should it insert duplicate records?**

**❌ NO** - But it currently IS inserting duplicates due to the futures vs real index issue we identified

### **3. Is this correct behavior?**

**✅ YES** for frequency (1 hour after market close)  
**❌ NO** for duplicates (should filter out futures data)

---

## 🔧 **DUPLICATE ISSUE CONFIRMED:**

### **Why You're Seeing Duplicates:**

1. **Service runs every 1 hour** during after-hours ✅ (correct)
2. **Collects both real indices AND futures** ❌ (wrong - causes duplicates)
3. **No duplicate checking** ❌ (wrong - should prevent same price duplicates)

### **Example from Your Data:**
```
Time: 07:01:41
SENSEX: 82,500.82 (real index) + 83,161.85 (futures) = 2 records
```

---

## 📋 **SUMMARY:**

**✅ Collection Schedule is Correct:**
- Market Hours: Every 1 minute
- After Hours: Every 1 hour  
- Pre-Market: Every 3 minutes

**❌ Duplicate Data Issue:**
- Service collects both real indices and futures
- No duplicate prevention by price
- Results in 2x records with different values

**🔧 Fix Applied:**
- Filter out futures (NFO/BFO exchanges)
- Add duplicate checking by price
- Ready to deploy when service is restarted

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION:**

**The 1-hour collection frequency during after-hours is CORRECT and BY DESIGN.**

**The duplicate data issue is a BUG that needs to be fixed** (which we've already prepared the fix for).

**Your service is working as intended for collection frequency!** ✅
