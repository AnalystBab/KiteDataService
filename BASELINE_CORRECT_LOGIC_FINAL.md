# ✅ BASELINE LOGIC - CORRECTED AND FINAL

## 🎯 **CORRECT UNDERSTANDING:**

**Baseline = Last record available for each strike in database**

NOT "previous business date"  
NOT "day before current business date"  
**JUST: Most recent record we have for each strike!**

---

## 📋 **YOUR SCENARIO TRACED:**

### **Oct 23, 8:45 AM - Service Starts**

**Database State:**
```
Last records are from Oct 20:
  SENSEX 83400 CE:
    RecordDateTime: 2025-10-20 15:29:00
    BusinessDate: Oct 20
    UC: 500

  NIFTY 24350 CE:
    RecordDateTime: 2025-10-20 15:29:00
    BusinessDate: Oct 20
    UC: 200
```

---

### **STEP 7: Business Date Calculation**
```
Time: 8:45 AM (before market opens)
Business Date: Oct 20 ✅
```

---

### **STEP 8: Circuit Limits Setup**

**NEW CODE (CORRECTED):**
```csharp
// Get LAST record for each strike (by RecordDateTime)
var lastRecords = await context.MarketQuotes
    .GroupBy(mq => mq.InstrumentToken)
    .Select(g => g.OrderByDescending(q => q.RecordDateTime).First())
    .ToListAsync();
```

**SQL Equivalent:**
```sql
SELECT InstrumentToken, UpperCircuitLimit, LowerCircuitLimit, RecordDateTime, BusinessDate
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY InstrumentToken ORDER BY RecordDateTime DESC) AS rn
    FROM MarketQuotes
) ranked
WHERE rn = 1;
```

**Result:**
```
For SENSEX 83400 CE:
  RecordDateTime: 2025-10-20 15:29:00
  BusinessDate: Oct 20
  UC: 500

Baseline: UC = 500 ✅ (Oct 20's last value)
```

---

### **Data Collection at 8:45 AM**

**Service collects current quotes from Kite API:**
```
SENSEX 83400 CE at 8:45 AM:
  Current UC from API: 600 (changed at 8:30 AM)
```

**Business Date assigned:** Oct 20 (from Step 7)

**Duplicate Check:**
```csharp
var existing = await context.MarketQuotes
    .Where(q => q.InstrumentToken == quote.InstrumentToken && 
               q.ExpiryDate == quote.ExpiryDate)
    .OrderByDescending(q => q.InsertionSequence)
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

// existing.UC = 500 (from Oct 20, 3:29 PM)
// quote.UC = 600 (current from API)

isDuplicate = (500 == 600)? NO ✅

// Save new record:
RecordDateTime: 2025-10-23 08:45:00
BusinessDate: Oct 20
UC: 600
InsertionSequence: 2 (increment from Oct 20's last sequence)
```

**Saved to database:**
```
SENSEX 83400 CE:
  RecordDateTime: 2025-10-23 08:45:00
  BusinessDate: Oct 20
  UC: 600
  InsertionSequence: 2
```

---

### **At 9:15 AM - Market Opens**

**STEP 7: Business Date Recalculated**
```
Historical Spot Data updated (now has Oct 23 data)
Nearest strike LTT: 2025-10-23 09:15:00
Business Date: Oct 23 ✅
```

**Data Collection at 9:15 AM:**
```
SENSEX 83400 CE:
  Current UC from API: 600 (unchanged)
  
Duplicate Check:
  existing.UC = 600 (from 8:45 AM record)
  quote.UC = 600
  isDuplicate = YES ✅
  
Action: SKIP (no change)
```

**No new record saved** ✅

---

### **At 10:23 AM - LC/UC Changes**

**Data Collection:**
```
SENSEX 83400 CE:
  Current UC from API: 700 (changed!)
  
Duplicate Check:
  existing.UC = 600
  quote.UC = 700
  isDuplicate = NO ✅
  
Save new record:
  RecordDateTime: 2025-10-23 10:23:00
  BusinessDate: Oct 23
  UC: 700
  InsertionSequence: 2 (first change on Oct 23)
  GlobalSequence: 3 (third record overall for this strike)
```

---

## ✅ **CORRECTED BASELINE LOGIC:**

**OLD CODE (WRONG):**
```csharp
// Get from "previous business date"
WHERE BusinessDate < currentBusinessDate
→ Gets Oct 17 data ❌
```

**NEW CODE (CORRECT):**
```csharp
// Get LAST record for each strike
.GroupBy(mq => mq.InstrumentToken)
.Select(g => g.OrderByDescending(q => q.RecordDateTime).First())
→ Gets Oct 20's last record ✅
```

---

## 🎯 **YOUR POINT ABOUT MULTIPLE CHANGES:**

You said:
> "During market hours there could be maximum only one change per day. If two times LC/UC changes during market hours that needs to be recorded in separate column"

**Current code handles this with `InsertionSequence`:**
```
Oct 23:
  09:15 AM: UC = 600, InsertionSequence = 1
  10:23 AM: UC = 700, InsertionSequence = 2 (second change)
  11:00 AM: UC = 800, InsertionSequence = 3 (third change!)
```

**But you want separate columns to track multiple changes?**

Should I create columns like:
- `FirstUC` - First UC value of the day
- `SecondUC` - Second UC value if changed
- `ThirdUC` - Third UC value if changed again
- `UCChangeCount` - How many times UC changed

**Is this what you mean?**
