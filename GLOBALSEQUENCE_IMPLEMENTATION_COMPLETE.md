# GlobalSequence Implementation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## üìã **WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED**

### **Problem Solved:**
`InsertionSequence` was resetting to 1 every business date, making it impossible to track the complete lifecycle of an options contract across multiple trading days.

### **Solution Implemented:**
Added **`GlobalSequence`** column that increments continuously across ALL business dates until the instrument expires.

---

## ‚úÖ **CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Database Schema**
```sql
-- Added new column
ALTER TABLE MarketQuotes 
ADD GlobalSequence INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- Added index for fast queries
CREATE INDEX IX_MarketQuotes_TradingSymbol_ExpiryDate_GlobalSequence 
ON MarketQuotes(TradingSymbol, ExpiryDate, GlobalSequence);
```

### **2. Model Updated**
**File:** `Models/MarketQuote.cs`

```csharp
public class MarketQuote
{
    // Existing PK (unchanged)
    public DateTime BusinessDate { get; set; }
    public string TradingSymbol { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public int InsertionSequence { get; set; }  // Daily sequence (resets per business date)

    // NEW: Cross-date sequence
    public int GlobalSequence { get; set; }  // Increments across ALL dates until expiry

    // ... other properties
}
```

### **3. Save Logic Updated**
**File:** `Services/MarketDataService.cs`

```csharp
// For FIRST record of an instrument
quote.InsertionSequence = 1;  // First for this business date
quote.GlobalSequence = 1;      // First globally for this contract

// For SUBSEQUENT records (LC/UC changed)
// Calculate DAILY sequence (resets per business date)
var maxDailySequence = await context.MarketQuotes
    .Where(q => q.InstrumentToken == quote.InstrumentToken && 
               q.ExpiryDate == quote.ExpiryDate &&
               q.BusinessDate == quote.BusinessDate)  // ‚Üê Same business date
    .MaxAsync(q => (int?)q.InsertionSequence) ?? 0;

quote.InsertionSequence = maxDailySequence + 1;

// Calculate GLOBAL sequence (continuous across all dates)
var maxGlobalSequence = await context.MarketQuotes
    .Where(q => q.TradingSymbol == quote.TradingSymbol && 
               q.ExpiryDate == quote.ExpiryDate)  // ‚Üê ALL business dates
    .MaxAsync(q => (int?)q.GlobalSequence) ?? 0;

quote.GlobalSequence = maxGlobalSequence + 1;
```

## üìä **HOW IT WORKS - EXAMPLE**

### **NIFTY 25100 CE (Expiry: 2025-10-24)**

```
BusinessDate    InsertionSeq  GlobalSeq  LC      UC      Explanation
2025-10-07      1             1          500     700     ‚Üê Initial load on Oct 7
2025-10-07      2             2          480     720     ‚Üê Changed on Oct 7
2025-10-07      3             3          460     740     ‚Üê Changed again on Oct 7
2025-10-08      1             4          440     760     ‚Üê Oct 8: DailySeq resets, GlobalSeq continues
2025-10-08      2             5          420     780     ‚Üê Changed on Oct 8
2025-10-09      1             6          400     800     ‚Üê Oct 9: DailySeq resets, GlobalSeq continues
2025-10-09      2             7          380     820     ‚Üê Changed on Oct 9
2025-10-10      1             8          360     840     ‚Üê Oct 10: DailySeq resets, GlobalSeq continues
...until expiry (2025-10-24)
```

### **Key Observations:**
- ‚úÖ **InsertionSequence**: Resets to 1 each business date (1, 2, 3 ‚Üí 1, 2 ‚Üí 1, 2 ‚Üí 1)
- ‚úÖ **GlobalSequence**: Continuously increments (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...)
- ‚úÖ **Scope**: GlobalSequence is per `(TradingSymbol, ExpiryDate)` combination
- ‚úÖ **Natural Boundary**: Sequence stops when contract expires

## üîç **SQL QUERIES - EXAMPLES**

### **1. Get Complete Lifecycle of a Contract**
```sql
-- Get ALL changes for NIFTY 25100 CE October expiry (across all business dates)
SELECT 
    BusinessDate,
    InsertionSequence AS DailySeq,
    GlobalSequence,
    LowerCircuitLimit AS LC,
    UpperCircuitLimit AS UC,

SELECT 
    TradingSymbol,
    Strike,
    OptionType,

SELECT 
    BusinessDate,
    GlobalSequence,
    InsertionSequence,
    LowerCircuitLimit,
    UpperCircuitLimit,
    LastPrice
FROM MarketQuotes
WHERE TradingSymbol = 'BANKNIFTY25OCT53500CE'

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY TradingSymbol, ExpiryDate ORDER BY GlobalSequence DESC) AS IsLast
    FROM MarketQuotes
    WHERE TradingSymbol LIKE 'NIFTY25OCT%'
      AND ExpiryDate = '2025-10-24'
)
SELECT 
    TradingSymbol,
    Strike,
    OptionType,
    CASE WHEN IsFirst = 1 THEN BusinessDate END AS FirstDate,
    CASE WHEN IsFirst = 1 THEN LowerCircuitLimit END AS InitialLC,
    CASE WHEN IsFirst = 1 THEN UpperCircuitLimit END AS InitialUC,
    CASE WHEN IsLast = 1 THEN BusinessDate END AS LastDate,
    CASE WHEN IsLast = 1 THEN LowerCircuitLimit END AS FinalLC,

## üìà **USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **When to Use InsertionSequence (Daily):**
- ‚úÖ Track changes within a **single business date**
- ‚úÖ Query: "How many times did LC/UC change TODAY?"
- ‚úÖ Daily analysis and reports
- ‚úÖ Intraday monitoring

**Example:**
```sql
-- Get all changes TODAY for NIFTY 25100 CE
SELECT * FROM MarketQuotes
WHERE BusinessDate = '2025-10-07'
  AND TradingSymbol = 'NIFTY25OCT25100CE'
ORDER BY InsertionSequence;
```

### **When to Use GlobalSequence (Cross-Date):**
- ‚úÖ Track **complete lifecycle** of a contract
- ‚úÖ Query: "Show me ALL changes from when this strike was added until expiry"
- ‚úÖ Historical analysis across multiple days
- ‚úÖ Pattern recognition and backtesting

**Example:**
```sql
-- Get complete history of NIFTY 25100 CE from first day to expiry
SELECT * FROM MarketQuotes
WHERE TradingSymbol = 'NIFTY25OCT25100CE'
  AND ExpiryDate = '2025-10-24'
ORDER BY GlobalSequence;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **1. Backward Compatibility**
- ‚úÖ Existing queries using `InsertionSequence` will continue to work
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to current functionality
- ‚úÖ `GlobalSequence` is an **addition**, not a replacement

### **2. Performance**
- ‚úÖ Index created for fast queries: `IX_MarketQuotes_TradingSymbol_ExpiryDate_GlobalSequence`
- ‚úÖ Queries filtering by `(TradingSymbol, ExpiryDate, GlobalSequence)` will be optimized

### **3. Data Integrity**
- ‚úÖ `GlobalSequence` increments automatically when LC/UC changes
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention required
- ‚úÖ Sequence is calculated per `(TradingSymbol, ExpiryDate)` - unique per contract

### **4. Existing Data**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Old data** (before this implementation) will have `GlobalSequence = 0`
- ‚úÖ **New data** (after this implementation) will have proper sequential values
- üí° **Recommendation**: If you want to backfill old data, run a migration script (can be provided if needed)

## üéØ **SUMMARY**

| Feature | InsertionSequence | GlobalSequence |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Scope** | Per BusinessDate | Across ALL BusinessDates |
| **Resets** | Daily (every new business date) | Never (until expiry) |
| **Use Case** | Daily change tracking | Full lifecycle tracking |
| **Max Value** | Usually 1-20 per day | Can be 100+ over contract life |
| **Query Filter** | BusinessDate + TradingSymbol | TradingSymbol + ExpiryDate |
| **Primary Use** | Intraday analysis | Historical/Backtesting |

## ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

- ‚úÖ Database column added
- ‚úÖ Index created
- ‚úÖ Model updated
- ‚úÖ Save logic implemented
- ‚úÖ Build succeeded
- ‚úÖ Ready for production

**Your requirement is now fully met! GlobalSequence will increment continuously across all business dates until the instrument expires.** üöÄ
