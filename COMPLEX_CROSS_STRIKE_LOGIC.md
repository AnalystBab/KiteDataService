# Complex Cross-Strike Logic Analysis

## Your Calculation Sheet Logic Breakdown:

### Step 1: PUT MINUS Calculation
```
84400 (spot last close strike) - 1420 (PE UC) = 82980
```

### Step 2: Call Base Strike Protection
```
Call base strike to 82980 = 1180
```
**Logic:** Market will not go below entire put minus (84400-1420=82980)
**Protection:** Call side preserves this 82980 level with 1180 premium

### Step 3: Premium Distribution
```
Call premium left: 516 rs
Put premium left: 240 rs
```

### Step 4: Strike Derivation
```
84400 - 516 (call premium) = 83884
```
**Target:** Find strike below 83884 → 83700

### Step 5: Pattern Matching
```
83700 PE UC = 568.30 rs
```
**Goal:** Find PE strikes whose LOW ≈ 568 rs
**Challenge:** We don't know LOW during market hours, only UC/LC

## The Complex Logic:

1. **Mathematical Derivation:** Use spot, UC values, and premium calculations to derive target prices
2. **Strike Selection:** Find strikes near derived target prices
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Match UC values with predicted LOW values
4. **Reason Attachment:** Each selected strike needs logical reasoning

## Pattern Discovery Requirements:

### Labels Needed:
- **PUT_MINUS:** Spot - PE UC
- **CALL_PROTECTION:** Call base strike to put minus level
- **PREMIUM_DISTRIBUTION:** Remaining call/put premiums
- **TARGET_STRIKE:** Derived strike from premium calculations
- **UC_TO_LOW_MAPPING:** UC values that predict LOW values

### Cross-Strike Relationships:
- **Mathematical:** 84400 → 82980 → 1180 → 516 → 83884 → 83700
- **Premium Transfer:** UC values transfer across calculated strikes
- **Protection Levels:** Call side protects put minus levels

### Complex Thinking Required:
1. **Derive target strikes** from mathematical relationships
2. **Find UC patterns** that predict LOW values
3. **Attach logical reasons** for each strike selection
4. **Cross-validate** with multiple strike relationships

This is MUCH more sophisticated than simple UC matching - it's about **mathematical derivation of target strikes** and **logical reasoning for pattern selection**!
