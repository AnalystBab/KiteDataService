✅ MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
 
📋 WHAT CHANGED:
  • Added FirstSeenDate column (when we FIRST discovered this instrument)

  • Added IsExpired flag (for easy filtering of expired instruments)
  • Created performance indexes
  • Initialized data for existing records
 
🎯 NEXT STEPS:

  2. Run the service - it will now refresh instruments every 30 minutes during market hours
  3. New strikes will be detected within 30 minutes of NSE introducing them
