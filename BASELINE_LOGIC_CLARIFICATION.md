# üìä BASELINE LOGIC - WHAT SHOULD IT BE?

## üéØ **YOUR SCENARIO TIMELINE:**

```
Oct 17 (Fri): Market OPEN - Last trading day before weekend
Oct 18-19: Weekend
Oct 20 (Mon): Market OPEN - Last trading day before holidays
Oct 21-22: HOLIDAYS
Oct 23 (Thu): Service starts at 8:45 AM, Market opens at 9:15 AM
```

## ‚ùì **KEY QUESTIONS:**

### **Q1: At 8:45 AM on Oct 23, what is Business Date?**

**Answer:** **Oct 20** (previous trading day - market not open yet)

---

### **Q2: At 8:45 AM, what should baseline LC/UC be?**

**You're asking:** Should it be from Oct 20 or Oct 17?

Let me think about the PURPOSE:

**Purpose of baseline:** To detect LC/UC CHANGES

**At 8:45 AM on Oct 23:**
- We're still in Oct 20 business date (market not open)
- We want to detect changes FROM Oct 20's values
- **Baseline should be from Oct 20** ‚úÖ

**But wait, that doesn't make sense for change detection!**

If:
- Current business date: Oct 20
- Baseline from: Oct 20
- Comparing Oct 20 data with Oct 20 baseline
- **No changes would be detected!** ‚ùå

## üí° **I THINK I FINALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT:**

### **The Real Question:**

**At 8:45 AM on Oct 23:**
- Business Date calculation says: Oct 20
- **BUT we're actually collecting NEW data on Oct 23!**
- This new data should be compared with: **Oct 20's LAST values**

**So:**
- New quotes collected at 8:45 AM should have BusinessDate = Oct 20
- But they should be compared with Oct 20's PREVIOUS records (earlier in the day)
- **OR should they have BusinessDate = Oct 23?**

---

## üéØ **THE CONFUSION:**

**At 8:45 AM on Oct 23, when we collect data:**

**Option A:** Tag it with BusinessDate = Oct 20 (market not open yet)
- Then compare with: Oct 17's data (previous business date)

**Option B:** Tag it with BusinessDate = Oct 23 (calendar date)
- Then compare with: Oct 20's data (last trading day)

---

**WHICH IS CORRECT?**

I think you're saying **Option B** is correct:
- Even before market opens, new data belongs to Oct 23
- Compare with Oct 20's last values
- When market opens, business date is already Oct 23

**Am I understanding correctly now?**
