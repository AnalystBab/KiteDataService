# üéØ CALL_MINUS PROCESS - CORRECTED (TRUE MINUS!)

## ‚ùå **MY MISTAKE:**
I was ADDING in step 2 and step 5, but it's called CALL_**MINUS**, so I should SUBTRACT!

---

## üî¥ **CALL_MINUS PROCESS (CORRECTED - All SUBTRACTIONS):**

### **Step 1: Take CE UC**
```
Close Strike CE UC = 1,920.85 ‚úÖ
```

### **Step 2: SUBTRACT from Spot ‚Üí CALL_MINUS**
```
82,100 - 1,920.85 = 80,179.15 ‚úÖ (CALL_MINUS)
```

### **Step 3: Distance from Put Base**
```
Put Base Strike = 84,700
CALL_MINUS = 80,179.15

Distance = 84,700 - 80,179.15 = 4,520.85 ‚úÖ
```

### **Step 4: SUBTRACT from PE UC ‚Üí Target Premium**
```
PE UC = 1,439.40
Target Premium = 1,439.40 - 4,520.85 = -3,081.45 ‚ùå NEGATIVE!
```

---

## ü§î **PROBLEM: NEGATIVE TARGET PREMIUM!**

This doesn't make sense... Let me think differently.

---

## üí° **NEW APPROACH - MIRROR PUT_MINUS EXACTLY:**

### **PUT_MINUS Pattern:**
```
1. Spot - PE UC = PUT_MINUS
2. PUT_MINUS - Call Base = Distance
3. CE UC - Distance = Target Premium
4. Spot - Target Premium = Target Strike
```

### **CALL_MINUS Pattern (Exact Mirror):**
```
1. Spot + CE UC = CALL_PLUS (or should this be MINUS?)
2. Put Base - CALL_PLUS = Distance
3. PE UC - Distance = Target Premium
4. Spot + Target Premium = Target Strike (or MINUS?)
```

---

## ü§Ø **I'M CONFUSED! Let me try different combinations:**

### **Option A: Full Subtraction**
```
1. Spot - CE UC = 82,100 - 1,920.85 = 80,179.15
2. Put Base - 80,179.15 = 84,700 - 80,179.15 = 4,520.85
3. PE UC - 4,520.85 = 1,439.40 - 4,520.85 = NEGATIVE ‚ùå
```

### **Option B: Subtract CE UC, but use difference calculation**
```
1. Spot - CE UC = 82,100 - 1,920.85 = 80,179.15
2. 80,179.15 - Put Base = 80,179.15 - 84,700 = -4,520.85 (negative distance)
3. PE UC + 4,520.85 = 1,439.40 + 4,520.85 = 5,960.25
4. Spot - 5,960.25 = 82,100 - 5,960.25 = 76,139.75 (way below!)
```

### **Option C: Use absolute distance differently**
```
Need your guidance here...
```

## üôè **PLEASE CORRECT MY APPROACH:**

**What I need to understand:**

1. **Step 1**: Is it `Spot - CE UC` or `Spot + CE UC`?
2. **Step 2**: How do I calculate distance from Put Base?
3. **Step 3**: What operation with PE UC?
4. **Step 4**: How to get target strike?
5. **Step 5**: What UC change do I monitor (PE UC)?
6. **Step 6**: Final prediction formula?

**I'm ready to learn the correct CALL_MINUS process step-by-step! üéì**
